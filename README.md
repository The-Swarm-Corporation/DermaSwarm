## Usage

Below is an example of how to use **DermaSwarm** in a typical dermatological workflow.

### Example


### Logging

**DermaSwarm** includes comprehensive logging powered by `loguru` to track agent decisions, references to peer-reviewed articles, and diagnostic conclusions. You can configure the logging settings to fit your clinicâ€™s compliance and documentation needs.

```python
from dermaswarm import configure_logging

# Configure logging
configure_logging(level="INFO", log_file="diagnosis_logs.log")
```

## API Integration

DermaSwarm can be easily integrated into any clinical software via its REST API interface. Below is an example request using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dermaswarm.com/diagnose \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "symptoms": {
    "rash": "red, scaly patches",
    "location": "forearm",
    "duration": "2 weeks",
    "itchiness": "severe"
  },
  "medical_history": {
    "allergies": ["pollen"],
    "current_medications": ["ibuprofen"]
  }
}'
```

### API Response

```json
{
  "diagnosis": "Psoriasis",
  "treatment_plan": {
    "medications": [
      {
        "name": "Topical Corticosteroids",
        "dosage": "Apply twice daily for 2 weeks"
      }
    ],
    "follow_up": "Reassess in 4 weeks for symptom improvement"
