"The process for performing Mohs surgery on a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the nose involves several key steps:
1. **Pre-operative Preparation:** The patient is informed about the procedure, and informed consent is obtained. Local anesthesia is administered to ensure comfort during the surgery.
2. **Layered Excision:** The surgeon carefully removes a thin layer of skin around and beneath the BCC, ensuring to mark the excised tissue for orientation.
3. **Microscopic Examination:** The excised tissue is processed and examined under a microscope to check for the presence of cancer cells. This step is crucial for determining if further excision is necessary.
4. **Re-excision if Needed:** If cancerous cells are detected, additional layers are excised until clear margins are confirmed.
5. **Wound Closure:** Once the margins are clear, the surgeon will discuss options for closing the wound, which may include primary closure or reconstructive techniques to optimize cosmetic outcomes.
6. **Post-operative Care:** The patient will receive instructions on how to care for the surgical site, manage pain, and recognize signs of complications. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor healing and assess for any recurrence.

**Example Interaction:**

**User Query:** "What is the recommended approach for a 55-year-old patient with a suspected basal cell carcinoma on the nose?"

**AI Response:**
"The recommended approach for a suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the nose involves a thorough evaluation, including a detailed history and physical examination. I would advise performing a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is confirmed, Mohs micrographic surgery is often the preferred treatment method due to its effectiveness in removing BCC while preserving healthy tissue, especially in cosmetically sensitive areas like the nose. Post-surgery, the patient should be educated on wound care, the importance of follow-up appointments, and sun protection to minimize the risk of recurrence. Regular skin examinations should also be encouraged as part of ongoing skin cancer surveillance."

**Example Interaction:**

**User Query:** "What are the treatment options for a patient diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris?"

**AI Response:**
"For a patient diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris, the primary treatment involves systemic corticosteroids to control the autoimmune response and reduce blister formation. High-dose corticosteroids may be initiated, followed by a tapering schedule based on clinical response. Additionally, adjuvant therapies such as rituximab can be considered for patients with severe or refractory disease. It's crucial to monitor the patient for potential side effects of corticosteroids, including osteoporosis and hypertension. Patient education on the chronic nature of the disease, the importance of adherence to treatment, and regular follow-up appointments is essential for effective management."
